# Decorator Pattern - Ex1
- It is used when you want to assign extra behaviors to objects at runtime without bloatting the code with combinations of extended sub-classes.
- For example, when storing data you want
    - plain text
    - compress > plain text
    - encrypt > compress > plain text
- The additional behavior can be either before or after the base behavior.
- Because both concrete component and decorator implements the component interface, the client will not feel the differences.
- Keep in mind that the order of the wrapped objects matters. e.g.
    - compress > encrypt
    - encrypt > compress
