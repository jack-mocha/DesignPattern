# Observer Pattern
- It notfies objects that subscribe to an object(Subject). Every time something changes in the Subject, those objects will be notified.
- There are 2 styles of passing data.
- **Push Style**
  - The value object is pushed to the subscribers through the notifying method.
    - Pros: Concrete Observer is not depending on Concrete Subject.
    - Cons: A new Observer may need a different set of value.
- **Pull Style**
  - Each subscriber can get the value it needs by having a refernce to the concrete subject.
    - Pros: More flexibility. 
    - Cons: The subscriber is depending on the concrete subject. However, this direction of dependency is ok. The other way around will not be good. We do not want a concrete subject to depend on a subscriber.
